# Design-of-SRAM-10T-Cell-in-Cadence-Virtuoso-and-it-s-DC-Analysis
The project involves designing and analyzing a 10T (10-transistor) SRAM cell using Cadence Virtuoso.The project workflow includes schematic design, layout creation, and verification through DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) to ensure manufacturing compliance.
